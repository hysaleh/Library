This is a simple Library Management System where the user can view the list of books and their availability, as well as search, check out and return books. This project started out from a tutorial video and I am currently expanding it to add more features and have a system where the reader can request books. I used Python for the initial LMS and will be using MySQL to accommodate for a larger selection of books.
